this is my home page of my portfolio. 


Hi I am Heather, a graphic designer with a passion for programming and accessible design. 

## About me


I completed my Honours Bachelor of Arts in _Art and Art History_ at both University of Toronto and Sheridan College co-currently. 

I focused on design for my art component of my degree, and I have since become interested in creating accessible designs, that are visually pleasing.
