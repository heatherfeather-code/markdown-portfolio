## About me

Hi I am Heather, a graphic designer with a passion for programming and accessible design. I completed my Honours Bachelor of Arts in _Art and Art History_ at the University of Toronto and Sheridan College co-currently. I focused on design for the art component of my degree, and I have since become interested in creating accessible designs, that are visually pleasing. 

In my free time I enjoy taking walks, reading, and playing video games. I also greatly value my social relationships with those in my life, and can often be socializing on weekends with extended family and friends.
